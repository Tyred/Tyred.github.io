I'm currently an AI Research Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Brazil, doing research on Deep Learning for health applications on Samsung smartphones and wearables.

I received my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the Federal University of São Carlos in 2022. During my time as an undergraduate I've accomplished two Undergraduate Research projects funded from FAPESP working with [Prof. Diego Furtado Silva](https://sites.google.com/view/diegofsilva), both in Machine Learning and Data Mining fields. I've also worked at Samsung as an Aritificial Intelligence R&D Intern.
